# Overview
The Multiplier Circuit, implemented using the Circom 2.0.0 language, is designed to validate whether a given value 'c' is the result of multiplying two input factors 'a' and 'b'. The circuit template employs logical gates to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons.
# Introduction
The goal of the Multiplier Circuit is to ensure the integrity of multiplication results. Given input values 'a' and 'b', the circuit template determines if the value 'c' is indeed their product. This is achieved through the creative application of logical AND, OR, and NOT gates, each contributing to the overall functionality of the circuit.
# Circuit Template Descriptions
Multiplier
This template encapsulates the core logic of the Multiplier Circuit. It accepts two input signals, 'a' and 'b', and computes intermediate values 'x' and 'y' through the utilization of AND, NOT, and OR gates. Ultimately, it conclusively determines whether 'c' represents the product of 'a' and 'b' by comparing the outputs of the OR gate.

NOT
The NOT gate template executes a logical NOT operation on an input signal 'a', demonstrating an elementary yet crucial logical operation.

AND
The AND gate template embodies the logical AND operation on two input signals, 'a' and 'b', showcasing the fundamental logic employed within the circuit.

OR
The OR gate template enacts a logical OR operation on two input signals, 'a' and 'b', spotlighting another essential facet of logical circuitry.
